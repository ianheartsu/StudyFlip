•	The solution to this problem is simple, flash cards. Even then it is difficult because students would have to spend time writing each card out, carry multiple sets around (at least 5 subjects worth) and it can easily get lost or stolen from other jealous classmates. The system I am proposing makes the whole study experience more worthwhile, reliable and efficient by making the study system intangible. The proposed solution is to make an online flash card system; which aims to improve learning by allowing students to interact with the software. Students create their own questions and answers, the answers being hidden when a question is viewed. The question and answers are stored through a database, which is integrated with the forms to insert and modify questions– where the flip cards will be viewed and retrieved from the database. When students feel confident with their topic, they can sit a test which tests their ability to answer each question and true knowledge on their respective topics; each topic is categorised and ordered in the website. If they answer the question correctly, they are given a point. If they answer incorrectly, the card gets sent to the “review again” and will be saved for future revision tests and a report is then created. The whole system is based on the students’ honesty, if they have got it right or wrong. Therefore the success of the student is entirely up to them. This proposed solution is to aid students and is a good supplement resource to their studies.
